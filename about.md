Hi, My name is Michael Libio. I'm currently living in Berlin and working of HERE (the mapping company of Nokia). 

### More Information

I'm a developer by night, while doing marketing and evangalism by day. Though it's been a while since I've done any serious coding, I must admit, I miss it a lot. To keep myself up-to-date with the current trends in web, mobile, and cloud technologies, I've decided to start this blog site and share my experience as I explore these topics.

Please feel free to contact me for any reason (feedback, recommendation, etc.)

Thanks again for visiting my blog site. I hope you've enjoyed it.
